                                                                 How to Monitor - Using Zabbix

1. Download and install Zabbix - https://www.zabbix.com/download
2. We will monitor all below important metrics in value or graph for a certain time duration (say 15/30 min):

  - CPU
      CPU used
      CPU load
      CPU temperature    
  - Memory usage
      Memory used
  - I/O
      Disk space usage
      IO read, IO write
  - Network
      Network traffic
      TCP connection states
  - SSL application
      SSL certificates validate status
  
2. For testing - try to add virtual load on the server. 

3. When a specific metrics limit value is reached, related trigger will be invoked, and alert message will be sent (via SMS/email)
